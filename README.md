# asterisk-config

This repo contains the code for my Asterisk phone server, including all of the additional functions that I have added to it. Most of these files are just stock configuraiton files needed for the program to function. The main bulk of the work done is in the `extensions.conf` file. Some of this code originated from the (NPSTN)[https://npstn.us/docs/] docs, but much of this code has been updated and modified for my enviornment.
